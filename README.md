# R-Project
Using R studio, I analyzed a cereal datasets which includes the nutritional facts on different cereals and it's rating. First did some data preprocessing, then found which variables had a significant relationship with the response variable(rating), and built a predictive model(linear mdoel) for the nutritional rating.
